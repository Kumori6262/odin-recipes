<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Evaporated milk: This coquito recipe starts with a can of evaporated milk.</li>
    <li>Eggs: Two beaten egg yolks contribute to the rich, thick, and creamy texture.</li>
    <li>Cream of coconut: Canned cream of coconut lends richness and gives the coquito its signature coconut flavor.</li>
    <li>Sweetened condensed milk: Sweetened condensed milk makes everything more delicious, including this coquito recipe!</li>
    <li>White rum: The best rum for coquito is white Puerto Rican rum, such as Bacardi. In a pinch, any pleasant-tasting white rum will do.</li>
    <li>Water: Water thins the thick and creamy mixture, making it super pourable.</li>
    <li>Vanilla: A teaspoon of vanilla extract takes the flavor up a notch.</li>
    <li>Spices: Cinnamon and cloves add warmth and coziness.</li>
